### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there. KLK,

I'm Greg. A rising Developer, creative thinker, and resilient problem solver who is always looking for new opportunities to learn more about the world.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on completing [heWitUs](https://hewitus.com/), a basketball league/tournament/team management app built with the MERN stack.
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I can likely be found either at a local basketball court shooting hoops, at a rehearsal studio playing guitar, or in a living room somewhere listening to the Velvet Underground.
